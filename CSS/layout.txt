layouts:

allow us to take elements contained in  a web page and control where
they are positioned realtive to-

- their default position in normal layout flow
- the other elements around them
- their parent container
- the main window/viewport

types:
	 
	block - one after the other, after line breaks
	inline - next to each other
	
	
	Compared to display: inline , the major difference is that 
	inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. 
	Also, with display: inline , top and bottom margins & 
	paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block 
	they are..
	
	
css layout techniques:
	
	normal flow - by default, the flow of the browser (display:none;)
	
	display property  (display:inline/block/inline-block)
	
	flexbox - flexible box layout (display:flex;)
			  put all the elements in a container and apply display:flex ot the parent container
			  all the direct children thus become flex items.
			  makes it easy to lay things out in one direction - either in a row or in a column
	
	floats - 
	positioning
	grids
	table layout
	multiple-column layout
