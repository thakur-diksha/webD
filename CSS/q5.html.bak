			<h1> INTERNET </h1>
			<p> The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks
				-- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, 
				get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers). 
				It was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969 and 
				was first known as the ARPANet. The original aim was to create a network that would allow users of
				a research computer at one university to "talk to" research computers at other universities. 
				A side benefit of ARPANet's design was that, because messages could be routed or rerouted in more
				than one direction, the network could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in 
				the event of a military attack or other disaster.
			</p>
			
			<p> Today, the Internet is a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to hundreds 
				of millions of people worldwide. It is used by many as the primary source of information consumption,
				and fueled the creation and growth of its own social ecosystem through social media and content 
				sharing. Furthermore, e-commerce, or online shopping, has become one of the largest uses of the 
				Internet.
			</p>
			
			<h2> How the Internet works </h2>
			<p>
			     Physically, the Internet uses a portion of the total resources of the currently existing public 
				 telecommunication networks. Technically, what distinguishes the Internet is its use of a set of 
				 protocols called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Two recent adaptations 
				 of Internet technology, the intranet and the extranet, also make use of the TCP/IP protocol.
		    </p>
			<p>
			    The Internet can be seen as having two major components: network protocols and hardware. 
				The protocols, such as the TCP/IP suite, present sets of rules that devices must follow in order 
				to complete tasks. Without this common collection of rules, machines would not be able to 
				communicate.
