layouts:

allow us to take elements contained in  a web page and control where
they are positioned realtive to-

- their default position in normal layout flow
- the other elements around them
- their parent container
- the main window/viewport

types:
	 
	block - one after the other, after line breaks
	inline - next to each other
	
	
	Compared to display: inline , the major difference is that 
	inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. 
	Also, with display: inline , top and bottom margins & 
	paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block 
	they are..

	display property
