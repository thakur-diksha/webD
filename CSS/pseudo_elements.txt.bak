pseudo-class and pseudo-element:

    pseudo class applies when state of element changes
	
	pseudo element when some part of element is changed
	
example:
	class ==> .nav:__  (single colon)
	element ==> .nav::__ (double colons)
	
	before and after --> 
				before applies before the class on which its put
				.nav::before
				
				after applies on elements after the class
				.nav::after
				
.nav::before{
	content="";
	margin:400px;
}

.p1::first-letter{
	font-size:40px;
	font-weight:900;
	color:white;
}
changes the way the first letter of this para looks

for first line, use the pseudo element first-line

.p1::selection{
	background-color:black;
	color:white;
	font-size:30px;
}
